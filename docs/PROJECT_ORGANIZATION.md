# Project Organization Guide

This document explains the logical organization of the Qwen inference engine project.

---

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Clean Root**: Only essential source files in root directory
2. **One Doc Per Role**: Each document has a clear, single purpose
3. **Phase-Based Testing**: One test file per phase
4. **Scalable Structure**: Easy to add future phases without clutter

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### docs/LEARNING_GUIDE.md
**Purpose**: Master implementation guide for ALL phases (0-4)

**Contents**:
- Architecture overview
- Phase 1: CUDA Kernels (Week 1-2)
- Phase 2: Attention (Week 3-4)
- Phase 3: FFN (Week 5-6)
- Phase 4: Integration (Week 7-8)
- Complete 8-week roadmap
- Resources and references

**When to read**: 
- After Phase 0 passes
- Before starting each new phase
- When stuck during implementation

### docs/PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md
**Purpose**: Phase 0 testing and completion status

**Contents**:
- How to run Phase 0 tests
- What each test verifies
- Troubleshooting guide
- Completion checklist
- Next steps

**When to read**:
- When verifying Phase 0
- If tests fail
- Before committing Phase 0

---

## 🧪 Test Structure

### Current: Phase 0
```
tests/test_phase0_initialization.cu
```
Tests: Weight loading, memory allocation, cuBLAS init

### Future: Phase 1
```
tests/test_phase1_kernels.cu
```
Will test: RMSNorm, RoPE, element-wise ops

### Future: Phase 2
```
tests/test_phase2_attention.cu
```
Will test: QK^T, softmax, V aggregation

### Pattern
- One test file per phase
- Clear naming: `test_phaseN_description.cu`
- Each test is independent
- All tests runnable separately

---

## 🔄 Future Organization

When implementing Phase 1, you'll add:

```
docs/
├── LEARNING_GUIDE.md              # No change (covers all phases)
├── PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md         # No change
└── PHASE1_VERIFICATION.md         # New: Phase 1 testing

tests/
├── test_phase0_initialization.cu  # No change
└── test_phase1_kernels.cu         # New: Phase 1 tests
```

**Root directory stays clean!** ✨

## 📖 Document Roles Explained

### Why separate LEARNING_GUIDE.md and PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md?

**LEARNING_GUIDE.md**:
- **Scope**: ALL phases (0-4)
- **Purpose**: Teaching & implementation
- **Audience**: Developer learning to implement
- **Length**: ~800 lines (comprehensive)
- **Updates**: Rarely (only for major changes)

**PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md**:
- **Scope**: Phase 0 only
- **Purpose**: Testing & verification
- **Audience**: Developer checking work
- **Length**: ~200 lines (focused)
- **Updates**: Only if tests change

**Benefit**: 
- Read LEARNING_GUIDE once at start
- Read PHASE0_VERIFICATION when testing
- No confusion about what to do vs how to verify

## 🎓 How to Use This Structure

### Starting Fresh (You are here!)
1. ✅ Read README.md (overview)
2. ✅ Build project
3. ✅ Run Phase 0 test
4. ✅ Read PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md
5. ➡️ Read LEARNING_GUIDE.md Week 1-2
6. ➡️ Implement Phase 1

### During Implementation
- **Stuck?** → LEARNING_GUIDE.md
- **Need to verify?** → PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md
- **Quick reference?** → README.md

### Adding New Phase
1. Implement in `qwen_model.cuh`
2. Add test: `tests/test_phaseN_*.cu`
3. Add doc: `docs/PHASEN_VERIFICATION.md`
4. Update README.md status
5. LEARNING_GUIDE.md unchanged (already covers it)

---

## 📊 Why This Organization?

### ✅ Benefits

1. **Clean Root**
   - Only 6 source files
   - Easy to navigate
   - Professional appearance

2. **Clear Purpose**
   - Each file has one job
   - No duplicate information
   - Easy to find what you need

3. **Scalable**
   - Add phases without cluttering
   - Pattern is clear
   - Future contributors understand quickly

4. **Maintainable**
   - Update only relevant docs
   - Tests independent
   - No cascade changes

### ❌ What We Avoided

1. **Cluttered Root**
   ```
   ❌ test_initialization.cu
   ❌ CHECKPOINT_PHASE0.md
   ❌ HOW_TO_VERIFY.md
   ❌ IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   ```
   Result: 10+ files in root

2. **Duplicate Information**
   - Same content in multiple files
   - Must update all when changes
   - Confusion about which is correct

3. **Unclear Naming**
   - `test_initialization.cu` - For which phase?
   - `CHECKPOINT.md` - Which checkpoint?

## 🔍 Quick Reference

### I want to...

**Learn how to implement Phase 1**
→ `docs/LEARNING_GUIDE.md` Week 1-2

**Verify Phase 0 works**
→ `docs/PHASE0_VERIFICATION.md`

**See project status**
→ `README.md`

**Add new functionality**

---

## Summary

**Current Structure**: 
- 2 docs (LEARNING_GUIDE + PHASE0_VERIFICATION)
- 1 test (Phase 0)
- 6 source files
- Clean and organized ✨

**Future Structure**:
- Add PHASE1_VERIFICATION.md when needed
- Add test_phase1_*.cu when needed
- LEARNING_GUIDE.md never changes
- Root stays clean

**Result**: Scalable, maintainable, professional project organization 🚀
